        <a href="https://www.overstory.com/">Overstory</a> 
      where I work on solving a wide variety of geospatial-related problems.
      My contributions include algorithm optimization
        e.g. using parallel processing,
        maintaining infrastructure and resource provisioning,

    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>
      I obtained my Masters degree in Systems & Control at the 
      <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/delft-center-for-systems-and-control">Delft Center for Systems and Control</a>
       of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">TU Delft</a>, 
        the Netherlands.
      My thesis involved the development of a 
      <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ad70c13ac-a992-4408-a7db-30033eec987d">novel, real-time optimization scheme</a>
      to re-order autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) in human-and-robot warehouses.
      This project was supported by and completed on-site at the 
      <a href="https://www.bosch-ai.com/">Robert Bosch Research Campus</a> in Renningen, Germany.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, I spent 9 months at the 
      <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>
      in Stockholm, Sweden, as a PhD student under the supervision of 
      <a href="https://people.kth.se/~hsan/">Henrik Sandberg</a>
      and 
      <a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/">Karl Henrik Johansson</a>
      as part of the 
      <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/">Division of Decisions and Control Systems</a>.
      My research focus was on 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oulLR06lj_E">data-driven control policies</a>
      applied to 
      <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/projects/cps/">cyber-physical systems</a>,
      after which I ended up pursuing a career in industry.
